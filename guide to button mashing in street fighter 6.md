## Description

As a big fan of Street Fighter 6, I have been wanting to get more people into the series so we can play together. Since most people claim that fighting games are notoriously difficult to learn and get into, we wanted to create a beginner friendly website that would ease the onboarding process.\nHere's how:\n- Easy to navigate pages\n- <strong>CLICKABLE LINKS</strong>\n- Character guides with condensed information
